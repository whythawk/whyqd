# Change log

## Version 1.2.0 (2025-03-13)

- Upgrading Pydantic from version 1 to 2. This is not backwardly compatible.
- Upgrading Modine and Ray.
- No functional or API changes.

## Version 1.1.3 (2024-03-08)

- Continuing to improve exception error messages to be more helpful.

## Version 1.1.2 (2024-03-08)

- Improved `CATEGORISE` action parser to handle greater variety of text edge cases (especially comma-separated terms).
- More helpful error messages for `TypeError` coercion problems where a specified type mismatch occurs.

## Version 1.1.1 (2024-02-12)

- Fixes for where source field names include special characters (newlines / tabs) or characters used in scripts. As whyqd is used for more this may need thorough review.

## Version 1.1.0 (2023-12-12)

- Fixes to tests

## Version 1.0.9 (2023-12-12)

- Added in new `usdate` data type which supports automatic date type coersion from US date formats (`MM-DD-YYYY`).
- New `COLLATE` action permitting scripts which collate a column-wise list of fields into an ordered `array` data type.
- Updated all dependencies, which necessitated a bump to the minimum supported Python version being 3.9.
- New tutorial to demonstrate the `COLLATE` and `usdate` features.
- Ray settings for initialisation will now be more forgiving. You don't need to provide default values.

## Version 1.0.8 (2023-08-10)

- CategoryModel terms now use StrictBool to avoid Pydantic's liberal interpretation of booleans.

## Version 1.0.7 (2023-08-09)

- Minor fix.

## Version 1.0.6 (2023-08-09)

- Minor fix.

## Version 1.0.5 (2023-08-09)

- Additional ambiguity checks for category term edge case where source or destination fields can share category names.

## Version 1.0.4 (2023-08-08)

- Ambiguity checks for string blank space. If source data includes, should not be removed to preserve original structure.

## Version 1.0.3 (2023-08-07)

- Disambiguation where schema subject and object field categories have the same name.

## Version 1.0.2 (2023-07-05)

- Dependency updates.

## Version 1.0.1 (2023-07-05)

- Permitting `nrow` limit on Parquet files.

## Version 1.0.0 (2023-05-10)

This version shares some features with the previous version, but is a complete refactoring and conceptual redesign. It is
not backwardly compatible. Future versions will maintain compatability with this one.

- Separated data models from schema models so that crosswalks are schema-to-schema.
- Complete revision of the API into four discrete `Definition` classes, `SchemaDefinition`, `DataSourceDefinition`,
  `CrosswalkDefinition` and `TransformDefinition`.
- Removed `filters` and `actions` that are no longer relevant (including `REBASE`, and `MERGE`).
- Simplified `CATEGORISE` since it no longer requires deriving terms as part of the crosswalk.
- Crosswalks are designed to support continuous integration.
- Pydantic models are more transparent via each `Definition`'s `.get` property.
- Refactored Pandas to support Modin and Ray for data >1 million rows.
- Mime type support for data sources in `Parquet` and `Feather`.
- Rewrote documentation in MKDocs from Sphinx.
- Revised all tutorials and documentation.
